# Flutter Packages

These packages have been created for my personal Flutter projects because I reuse this code accross all my Flutter projects.
To avoid some copy/paste across all the projects and annoying updates, I have created this repository as a single source for my reusable code.

Also, since I write some articles about coding with Flutter, these packages are public so everybody can access it.

It currently includes:
- platform: I like ui to be formatted depending on Android or iOS so I always include a few changes between platforms. These classes perfectly handle those differences.
- form: some ui stuff to format the form views (textfields, pickers, etc)

NOTE: I will update and/or maintain these packages for my internal projects only. Breaking changes may be introduced at any time.
